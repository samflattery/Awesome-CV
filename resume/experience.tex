      \item Worked on the \href{https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation}{SafetyNet Attestation API}, an anti-abuse platform written in C++ which assesses device side integrity on Android devices
        \item Designed and implemented a principled way to process device information and produce a new integrity verdict for a new class of device
        % \item Added monitoring metrics and a graphical dashboard to this system to allow the onduty to recognize and respond to scaled abuse
        \item Extended the system that calculates preexisting \href{https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation\#potential-integrity-verdicts}{integrity verdicts} to make it more configurable, scalable and easier to debug
        \item This new system is on the critical path to assessing over 1 billion devices daily
        % \item During the three month internship, two other team members have already used this new infrastructure to simplify their parts of the system

        \item Created a randomized testing system for \href{https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy}{Envoy}, an open source L7 proxy
        % \item Wrote a fuzz target for Envoy's xDS protocol, which provides a centralized infrastructure for distributing config files to Envoy nodes
        \item Implemented an abstract state tracker that maintained the correct state of the system to ensure updates were properly processed after executing the randomized input
        \item Fixed two logical bugs in Envoy's implementation found through this testing method
        \item Increased coverage over key files by more than 40\%
