      \begin{cvitems}
        \item Reduced damage caused by made-for-abuse accounts by 20\% across Google by challenging potentially abusive users with anti-abuse challenges when trying to access non-essential Google services
		\item Designed and implemented the challenge policies in Java with configurable arms to rapidly react to changes in abuse
		\item Created the frontend and backend of the UX flow seen by XXXk users a day telling them why they are restricted, allowing them to pass challenges, and eventually unrestricting them after passing
		\item Developed monitoring dashboards, real time metrics, and SQL queries to analyse the impact of the rollout and detect issues
      \end{cvitems}

	  \item Worked on the \href{https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7162782}{Action Protection} team, responsible for protecting sensitive actions like password changes against hijacking with a risk-based system to challenge users with 2FA challenges
	  \item Overhauled the UX flow shown to non-2FA users to allow them to seamlessly enroll and proceed with the attempted action, unblocking XXk daily
	  \item Engaged with clients like Gmail, Payments and Ads to offer design reviews, integration support and land feature requests

      \item Worked on the \href{https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation}{SafetyNet Attestation API}, an anti-abuse platform written in C++ which assesses device side integrity on Android devices
        \item Designed and implemented a principled way to process device information and produce a new integrity verdict for a new class of device
        % \item Added monitoring metrics and a graphical dashboard to this system to allow the onduty to recognize and respond to scaled abuse
        \item Extended the system that calculates preexisting \href{https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation\#potential-integrity-verdicts}{integrity verdicts} to make it more configurable, scalable and easier to debug
        \item This new system is on the critical path to assessing over 1 billion devices daily
        % \item During the three month internship, two other team members have already used this new infrastructure to simplify their parts of the system

      \begin{cvitems}
        \item Created a testing system in C++ for exercising code paths in \href{https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy}{Envoy}, an open source L7 proxy, with randomized inputs
        % \item Wrote a fuzz target for Envoy's xDS protocol, which provides a centralized infrastructure for distributing config files to Envoy nodes
        \item Implemented an abstract state tracker that maintained the correct state of the system to ensure updates were properly processed
        \item Fixed two logical bugs in Envoy's implementation found through this testing method
        \item Increased testing coverage over key files by more than 40\%
