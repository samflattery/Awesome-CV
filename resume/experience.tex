      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item Worked on the \href{https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation}{SafetyNet Attestation API}, an anti-abuse platform which assesses device side integrity on Android devices
        \item Designed and implemented a principled way to process device information and produce a new integrity verdict for a new class of device
        \item Added monitoring metrics and a graphical dashboard to this system to allow the onduty to recognize and respond to scaled abuse
        \item Extended the system that calculates preexisting \href{https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation\#potential-integrity-verdicts}{integrity verdicts} in a way that made it more configurable, scalable and easier to debug
        \item This new system is on the critical path to assessing over a billion devices daily
        \item During the three month internship, two other team members have already used this new infrastructure to simplify their parts of the system

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item Worked with the security team to find bugs in \href{https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy}{Envoy}, an open source L7 proxy, through randomized fuzz testing
        \item Wrote a fuzz target for Envoy's xDS protocol, which provides a centralized infrastructure for distributing config files to Envoy nodes
        \item Implemented an abstract state tracker that maintained the correct state of the nodes to verify that updates to the configurations were properly processed after executing the fuzzed input
        \item Fixed two logical bugs in Envoy's implementation of xDS found by my fuzzer
        \item Increased fuzz coverage over key files by more than 40\%
